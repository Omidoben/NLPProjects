### 1. Spam Classifier
- This project is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that classifies text messages as spam or ham. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as lemmatization and stopword removal. A Bag-of-Words model was built using CountVectorizer, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained for prediction. The model achieved high accuracy of 98.38% in identifying spam messages.
