# Natural Language Processing Projects Collection

A collection of various NLP projects.

## Projects

### 1. Spam Classifier
- This project is a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that classifies text messages as spam or ham. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as lemmatization and stopword removal. A Bag-of-Words model was built using CountVectorizer, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained for prediction. The model achieved high accuracy of 98.38% in identifying spam messages.


#### 2. Stock Price Sentiment Analysis
- This project involves building a machine learning model to predict stock market sentiment (positive or negative movement) based on top financial news headlines. The data was preprocessed using text cleaning techniques and vectorized using TF-IDF with unigrams and bigrams. A Random Forest Classifier was tuned using time-series cross-validation to ensure reliable performance on unseen data. The final model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC AUC, and key influential words were identified using feature importance.
